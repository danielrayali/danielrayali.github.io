            I have a few ideas in mind for what next to program. They include
            writing a 4-function calculator and an about page that should show
            the content from my first blog post. Both of which you can see in
            the navigation menu at the top, but are both broken as of this
            writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, I noticed when switching between the pages I have, the
            navigation must be represented in each page. I know about the DRY
            principal and want to apply it here. I'd rather not copy/paste the
            code onto each page, I'd rather have that source from a single
            location. I want to do something similar with the about page and
            have it serve the first blog post entry. That way when I re-write it
            as DnD fan fiction, it will update automatically (totally kidding,
            sorta).
          </p>

          <p>
            In my humble opinion the navigation portion seems like the most
            important feature to get right first. This will also help craft the
            about page. While I'm sure everyone is constantly hitting refresh to
            use the calculator but I'm afraid it will have to wait.
          </p>

            Holy moly, creating re-usable HTML is not a simple thing. I learned
            that I would probably have to server a dynamic HTML page. This means
            setting up a web application in addition to a web server (two
            processes already???). The web application will piece together the
            request page and send it to the web server to return to the user.
            This means diving into server-side programming almost right away,
            which I did not anticipate.
          </p>

            Rust has always been something I've flirted with, but never actually
            dated in a professional sense. I want to use Rust as my back-end
            language, even though MSDN recommends Python + Django because its
            cool. After flippantly deciding which language I wanted to focus on,
            I asked Perplexity AI to write a Rust-based web application for a
            blogging website. To me, what is useful about this is knowning what
            a code base that does this generally looks like. I learned in its
            response that it anticipated using a HTML template engine called
            Tera. Now we're cutting through all that other stuff to get to what
            I really wanted; dynamic HTML pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an aside, I wonder too if this means I can't just use GitHub
            Pages to serve up some static webpages &#128577;. My guess is GitHub
            would probably not host a bunch of custom binaries serving files
            from their servers. So long free hosting...
          </p>

          <p>
            I installed Rust on my Windows 11 laptop and started putting an
            application together. I will update on my progress, but it won't be
            reflected until I can figure out what I have to do for hosting.
            Running my own server would be cool though.

            Hello, I am a computer engineer that typically works on embedded
            Linux devices. I have wanted to learn how to build a website for
            some time now. I believe the best way to learn is to do, so I will
            be attempting to document my progress and make various features
            around this content. Something of a self-licking ice cream cone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am aware of a myriad of web development frameworks, node.js,
            databases, dynamic content, etc. that all help speed up the
            development of building a website and its features, but I'm just
            beginning on my understanding of web development. I plan on learning
            as much as I can about each of these, but I also want to do this the
            right way and start from the ground up. As far as I can tell, the
            web is built on HTML and CSS, so I thought that would be a good
            place to start. I am dating myself here, but I also have some
            experience with HTML from customizing my MySpace page back in the
            day. My online friends had to know which Alient Ant Farm lyrics best
            represented my current mood.
          </p>

            My goal is to eventually get OK and somewhat bored of writing my own
            HTML/CSS and find something that can do most of this work for me.
            I'm assuming there are tools out there to help you get formatting
            right for different devices (or something called a ViewPort?). So
            for now, I will be writing a lot of HTML/CSS and experimenting on
            how best utilize it. I also think it means faster load times
            compared to websites that utilize lots of third-party libraries for
            fast feature development. Nothing against those websites, but this
            is something I plan on keeping in mind during my progress, least I
            end up creating a real
