## Todo

* The blog entry text is aligned due to padding at 20% on each side. When presented on any screen though it will always add this 20% which is not ideal for smaller screens (ViewPorts?). Adjust it so it doesn't add this padding under a certain screen size.

Shift + Alt + f will format HTML code.
